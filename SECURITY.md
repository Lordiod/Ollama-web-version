- **Initial Response**: We will provide an initial response within 7 days, including our assessment of the report
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress as we work to address the issue
- **Resolution**: We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed

### Security Best Practices

When using this application:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive environment variables to version control
2. **Supabase Configuration**: Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies in your Supabase database
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The main application code
- API endpoints
- Authentication mechanisms
- Data handling and storage
- Third-party integrations

### Out of Scope

The following are typically out of scope:

- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to the respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to servers

## Security Features

This application implements several security measures:

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication via Supabase Auth
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all user inputs
- **CORS**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration
- **Environment Isolation**: Separation of development and production configurations
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript implementation to prevent type-related vulnerabilities

## Thank You
